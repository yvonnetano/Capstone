Project Summary: Laptop Price Prediction System
This capstone project delivers a machine learning solution that predicts laptop prices using detailed technical specifications. Developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, the system runs seamlessly in a browser via MyBinder. Users interact with a clean interface to input laptop features and receive an estimated price prediction instantly.
 Key Highlights
•	ML Approach: Utilizes a supervised learning model. A Linear Regression to forecast laptop prices.
•	Data Processing: Transforms input specs like brand, processor, and graphics card using one-hot encoding for accurate modeling.
•	User Interaction: Features an easy-to-use interface built with ipywidgets, allowing real-time input and price prediction.
•	Web Accessibility: No setup required simply open the notebook in Binder and start predicting.
•	Insights and Evaluation: Visual tools such as scatter plots help compare predicted prices against actual data.
