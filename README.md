Project Summary: Laptop Price Prediction System
This capstone project delivers a machine learning solution that predicts laptop prices using detailed technical specifications. Developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, the system runs seamlessly in a browser via MyBinder. Users interact with a clean interface to input laptop features and receive an estimated price prediction instantly.
 Key Highlights
•	ML Approach: Utilizes a supervised learning model. A Linear Regression to forecast laptop prices.
•	Data Processing: Transforms input specs like brand, processor, and graphics card using one-hot encoding for accurate modeling.
•	User Interaction: Features an easy-to-use interface built with ipywidgets, allowing real-time input and price prediction.
•	Web Accessibility: No setup required simply open the notebook in Binder and start predicting.
•	Insights and Evaluation: Visual tools such as scatter plots help compare predicted prices against actual data.
How to Get Started
1.	Click the Binder link below.
2.	Select “Restart the kernel and run all cells” to initialize the notebook. Use the !pip install command to download the required libraries if a message "ModuleNotFoundError" displays after clicking the Restart and run all cells button.
3.	Libraries to download: !pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn ipywidgets
4.	Reload the page after all the libraries are downloaded.
5.	Scroll to the Futuristic Laptop Price Predictor dashboard section.
6.	Click the Technical Specs tab and use the sliders to select specs.
7.	Click the Brand/OS/Type tab and use the dropdowns to select options.
8.	Click the Predict Price Now button to view price predictions.
